# 🚀 Selected Projects

A curated list of things I've built, explored or incubated. Open source, experiments, platforms and a bit of playful creativity.

---

## 🌳 GenerationsHeritage
Open source family tree / digital heritage platform preserving multi‑generational stories, relationships and artifacts for the future.

**Stack / Themes:** Data modeling, graph relationships, long‑term digital preservation, export formats.

🔗 Repo: https://github.com/vcscsvcscs/GenerationsHeritage

---

## 📚 AI Book Translator
Translate entire eBooks (chapters, structure, footnotes) into your preferred language while preserving layout and semantic integrity. Uses LlamaIndex to orchestrate multiple LLM providers for flexibility and quality.

**Features:** EPUB reconstruction • Multi‑provider LLM abstraction • Structured parsing • Integrity‑first transformation.

🔗 Repo: https://github.com/vcscsvcscs/ai-book-translator

---

## ☸️ OCI Kubernetes Cluster with Traefik
Two Kubernetes cluster setups: Oracle OKE (managed) and a self‑managed alternative. Includes ingress with Traefik and infrastructure as code patterns.

**Focus:** Multi‑environment parity • Operational clarity • Reproducible cluster provisioning.

🔗 Repo: https://github.com/vcscsvcscs/OCI-Kubernetes-cluster-with-traefik

---

## 🧩 42 Jigsaw Puzzle Games (WIP)
Collection of Godot‑based puzzle game prototypes made with a friend (Peti). A playground for UX, input systems and casual game feel.

**Explorations:** Level generation • Input comfort • Session pacing.

🔧 Engine: Godot

---

## 📡 Proximity Dating App (WIP)
Building a privacy‑aware close‑proximity dating experience emphasizing authenticity & real‑world timing rather than endless swipes.

**Ideas:** Ephemeral local windows • Device side filtering • Trust & safety overlays.

Status: Early development / architecture shaping.

---

## 🛡 Survivors Vault
Flutter based static tips & tricks companion app. Focused on fast offline access and concise survival knowledge packaging.

**Focus:** Offline UX • Lightweight content pipeline • Rapid iteration with Flutter.

---

## 🔒 BetterLockIn
Motivational mobile app (Flutter) inspired by “winter arc” mindset—tough love over gentle nudges. Track streaks, challenge friends and embrace grind energy.

**Themes:** Habit loops • Social accountability • Resilient UI states.

---

## 🏠 Self‑Hosting Family Homelab
Home infrastructure stack (OMV + Nextcloud + Gitea + Penpot + Navidrome + LocalAI) providing private collaboration, media streaming and on‑prem AI experimentation.

**Principles:** Ownership • Observability • Maintainability • Low friction updates.

---

## 🧠 AI Deployments on Modal
Ad‑hoc LLM & image generation services using Modal for fast prototyping and ephemeral compute. Used for internal experimentation and creative tooling.

**Patterns:** Serverless GPU bursts • Rapid iteration • Composable pipelines.

---

## 🧪 Coming Soon / Incubating
- 🧬 GenerationsHeritage: Vector‑powered ancestral insight engine (embeddings, semantic lineage queries, timeline clustering)
- 📖 AI Book Translator: Structural translation quality scorer + adaptive output consistency pipeline (layout, tone & provider variance mitigation)
- 📍 Proximity Dating Core: Privacy‑preserving ephemeral proximity matching (encrypted radius logic, on‑device filtering, anti‑spam trust signals)
