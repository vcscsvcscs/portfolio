## Since AI Hackathon 2025
**November 21–23, 2025**  
**EduCity, Turku, Finland**  
260+ builders • 30+ AI projects • 6 partner companies

I'm thrilled to share that my team and I won **1st place** in the Sandvik Main Challenge at the Since AI Hackathon in Turku, Finland! After 48 hours of intense teamwork, we developed a state-of-the-art AI solution to a real-world industry problem, and I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved.

## The Challenge

We tackled Sandvik's customer support challenge by building a custom AI classification model and data pipeline to streamline customer support requests and route them to the appropriate support teams. This solution addresses a critical operational need: efficiently categorizing and distributing incoming support tickets to ensure faster response times and better resource allocation.

## Our Solution

Our approach combined:
- **Custom AI Classification Model**: A tailored machine learning model trained to understand and categorize support requests accurately
- **Data Pipeline**: An efficient processing system that handles incoming requests and routes them through the classification system
- **Team Collaboration**: Working closely with Péter Erdős, Juhana Kaarlehto, and Kirill Nikolaev to deliver a production-ready solution

## The Experience

The hackathon brought together 260+ builders working on 30+ AI projects across 6 partner companies. The energy at EduCity in Turku was incredible, and the level of innovation on display was inspiring.

Huge thanks to the organizers, especially Yuehan John, for running such a well-organized event. I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited about the new professional connections I've made along the way.

Thank you to my amazing teammates: **Péter Erdős**, **Juhana Kaarlehto**, and **Kirill Nikolaev** — this victory belongs to all of us!
