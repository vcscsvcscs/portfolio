## Code Budapest #LikeABosch 2022
**2022**  
**Budapest, Hungary**

I participated in the Code Budapest #LikeABosch 2022 hackathon with my team, where we worked on the Software Challenge. This event was a significant milestone in my career, as it led directly to my recruitment by Bosch.

## The Challenge

We tackled the challenge of processing Ego's sensor array data to build a comprehensive object tracking system around vehicles. The key innovation was our ability to track objects even when they were in sensor blind spots, addressing a critical challenge in autonomous vehicle perception systems.

## Our Solution

Our approach focused on:
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Analyzing and processing data from Ego's multi-sensor array
- **Object Tracking**: Building a robust tracking system that maintains object identity across sensor coverage areas
- **Blind Spot Handling**: Implementing algorithms to predict and track objects even when they move through areas not directly covered by sensors
- **Real-time Performance**: Ensuring the system could process sensor data in real-time

## Technology Stack

We built our solution using:
- **Python 3**: Core development language
- **Python Arcade**: For visualization and demonstration of the tracking system

## The Team

Thank you to my talented teammates:
- **Alex Milos**
- **Benedek Rubóczki**
- **Neszlényi Kálmán**

## Career Impact

This hackathon had a profound impact on my career. After demonstrating our solution and the technical skills we brought to the challenge, I was directly recruited by Bosch. This experience highlighted the value of hackathons not just as learning opportunities, but as platforms for professional growth and career advancement.

## Gratitude

I would like to express my gratitude to **CraftHub** and **Bosch Magyarország** for organizing this wonderful event. The hackathon provided an excellent platform to showcase technical skills, collaborate with talented developers, and connect with industry leaders.
