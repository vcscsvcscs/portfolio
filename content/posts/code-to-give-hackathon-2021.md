## Code to Give Hackathon by Morgan Stanley
**June 24, 2021**  
**Finals**

I'm proud to share that my team and I reached the finals of the Code to Give Hackathon by Morgan Stanley and finished in **3rd place**! This was a meaningful project that combined technology with social impact.

## The Mission

We developed an educational software platform designed specifically for bedridden children in hospitals. The platform, similar to Canvas (the learning management system), provides a way for young patients to continue their education while receiving medical treatment.

## The Challenge

Children who are hospitalized for extended periods face significant challenges in maintaining their education. Traditional classroom attendance becomes impossible, and they risk falling behind their peers. Our solution aimed to bridge this gap by providing a dedicated educational platform tailored to their unique circumstances.

## Our Solution

We created a comprehensive educational platform that:
- **Accessibility**: Designed with hospital environments in mind, ensuring usability from hospital beds
- **Educational Content**: Provides structured learning materials and assignments
- **Progress Tracking**: Allows students and educators to monitor learning progress
- **Engagement**: Keeps young patients engaged with their studies during difficult times

## Impact

This project was particularly meaningful because it addressed a real social need. By helping bedridden children maintain their education, we could contribute to their long-term success and well-being, even during challenging health circumstances.

## The Experience

Reaching the finals of a Morgan Stanley hackathon was an incredible achievement. The competition was fierce, and being recognized among the top teams validated our technical approach and the social impact of our solution.

This hackathon experience reinforced my belief in using technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive difference in people's lives.
