## European Defense Tech Hackathon, Milan
**October 3–5, 2024**  
**Milan, Italy**

I'm grateful for the opportunity to participate in the European Defense Tech Hackathon in Milan, where I learned more about defense technology and connected with many talented professionals. I'm proud to share that our team secured **3rd place** with our innovative project!

## The Project: Super Laser 2

We developed **Super Laser 2**, a laser-based, stealth drone-to-drone communication system exploring next-generation secure networking in contested environments. The system supports:

- **Base-to-Drone Communication**: Secure laser-based links between ground stations and drones
- **Drone-to-Drone Communication**: Direct peer-to-peer communication between drones using light (lasers) and receivers
- **Stealth Operation**: Low probability of intercept/detection (LPI/LPD) characteristics
- **Mirror-Based Relay**: Small mirrors enable complex routing and extended range

## Technical Approach

Our solution utilized light-based communication technology with lasers, receivers, and small mirrors to create a robust communication network. This approach offers significant advantages in electronic warfare environments where traditional RF communications are vulnerable to detection and jamming.

## Post-Hackathon Development

After the hackathon, we explored opportunities to further develop this project with Fincantieri, one of the event's key partners. While we ultimately decided not to move forward with the collaboration, the experience provided valuable insights into defense technology development and industry partnerships.

## The Team

Thank you to my incredible teammates: **Fabian Högger**, **Michele Soldi**, **Matteo Rocco**, and **Giulio Capello**. Working with such a talented group made this experience truly memorable.

## Recognition

The hackathon featured impressive projects across defense innovation, including drone interception systems, stealth communications, and multi-sensor detection systems. Being recognized among such innovative work was a true honor.
